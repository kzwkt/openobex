How to compile OpenObex
=======================

The compilation of OpenObex is done using CMake.
The following OBEX transports are available:
 * Bluetooth (not all systems, see below)
 * Irda (not all systems, see below)
 * TCP
 * USB
 * Custom transport
 * File descriptor

The following operating systems are supported:
 * Linux [Bluetooth, Irda]
 * FreeBSD [Bluetooth]
 * NetBSD [Bluetooth]
 * Windows [Bluetooth(MS stack), Irda]

Non-listed operating systems may still be supported. For Windows operating
system, please see INSTALL_Win32.txt.


1 Requirements
==============

1. a C compiler (e.g. GCC)
2. LibUSB [1]
3. CMake(>= 2.8.5)[2]

2 Compilation
=============

It is recommended to not build in the source directory. To build in any other
directory, just run cmake with the path to the source directory as last
argument. A mix of this is a 'build' subdirectory in the source tree. The
example below uses this method.

At the command line, run:
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

You can also use a substitute like cmake-gui or ccmake. Different build
front-ends are also possible, the default are "Unix Makefiles".
You might want to adjust the installation prefix by changing the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable like, the default is /usr/local.


3 Installation
==============

Then you can install the files by running the "install" make target.
When using CMake, the "package" make target will create a compressed tarball
with the binaries.
